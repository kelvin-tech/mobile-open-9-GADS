Functionality of a voting app
Remote' systems that allow voters to vote from any computer connected to the internet  
typically at home or at work. As well as via PCs, home internet voting could be through digital TV
or even mobile phones or games machines. Remote internet voting might be used to replace
poll site voting entirely, or it might be used only for absentee balloting.

What are the components of a normal voting system that we would need to incorporate into our online one?
•	registration of candidates(via app/link),
•	preparation of polling list(we validate the authentic voters by checking if they are of age and   are not fraudulent. This where the checking with the web cam and id scan),
•	voting 
•	Counting of votes.(we never spoke of this part in the meeting)
•	auditing, reviewing of complaints (is this necessary? It should be part of a real voting app since complaints can help make the app better). let me know what you think of this
Actions for the admin:	
•	Admin cannot vote with admin account
•	Admin cannot write any votes to the dbs
Users
•	Vote cannot be reversed
•	Confirmation of vote before its cast

System should be as light as possible (small size)
Proposal of how the votes will work
•	Enter Voter Name.
•	Show the election questions in a list box.(idk what questions lol I’ve never voted before but my dad says there are questions)
•	Voter chooses a candidate to vote for from the selected ballot and the candidate will be displayed 
•	Candidate should be able to change the candidate they’ve selected from the ballot after they’ve selected the ballot and the candidate
•	Submit button to submit the vote and thereafter:
•	Vote cannot be reversed
•	Confirmation message to ask users are sure of the candidate they’ve chosen and also letting them know that the vote ant be reversed
